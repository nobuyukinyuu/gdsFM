Experimental FM Synth written in GDScript and C#.

NOTE:  This project has been superceded by [PhaseEngine](https://github.com/nobuyukinyuu/PhaseEngine), which utilizes fixed-point math based loosely off the [ymfm](https://github.com/aaronsgiles/ymfm) core.  This repository will remain for historical purposes and as an example of an FM synthesizer project built from the ground-up with no foreknowledge of how typical FM cores are constructed when it was started.
